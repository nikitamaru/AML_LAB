Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area extends out from the Oregon coast, one mile into the Pacific Ocean. Standing 93 feet tall at the westernmost point of the basalt headland, the lighthouse has been a bright beacon of the night, guiding ships and their supplies along the west coast since the light was first lit on August 20, 1873. The offshore islands are a year-round refuge for harbor seals and a spring-summer home for thousands of nesting seabirds. Gray whales can be spotted during their annual migrations to Mexico (late fall-early winter) and Alaska (late winter-early spring). During the summer months some gray whales take the opportunity to feed in the shallow waters around the headland. Cobble Beach is compiled of millions of round basalt rocks that produce an applause-like sound as the waves roll in. When the tide is low a vibrant ocean floor is revealed—pools of colorful animals including orange sea stars, purple sea urchins, and giant green anemones. Rangers are at hand to answer questions and point out all of the amazing plants and animals that call the tide pools home. Visit the Interpretive Center and discover 140 years of lighthouse history and thousands of years of natural and cultural history. Friends of Yaquina Lighthouses, a non-profit organization, offers site-related books, maps, and postcards in their interpretive store. Whether you want to see raging winter storms batter the Oregon coast, learn about the role lighthouses played in the westward expansion of the United States, or watch peregrine falcons at play, visit Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area and experience something wild.","750 NW Lighthouse Dr, Newport, OR 97365-1347",,"Szabo's Steakhouse and Seafood,Izzy's Pizza Restaurant,Bonnie's Espresso","Quarry Cove,Cobble Beach,South Beach State Park",1422,356,56,10,5,-1,-1

To get there, you'll need to take a 15-minute hike across slippery lava rocks, so wear a good pair of shoes. In summer, the pool resembles a large hot tub and the waters are calm and clear.

During winter, however, the water can be treacherous, so avoid visiting during those months; the pool may even be closed. Before you go, be sure to check the surf report online, and only attempt the hike down if the waves are less than four feet high.

Today McLeod Plantation is an important 37-acre Gullah/Geechee heritage site that has been carefully preserved in recognition of its cultural and historical significance. The grounds include a riverside outdoor pavilion, a sweeping oak allée, and the McLeod Oak, which is thought to be more than 600 years old. It is a place like no other, not frozen in time but vibrant, dynamic, and constantly evolving, where the winds of change whisper through the oak trees and voices from the past speak to all who pause to listen. McLeod Plantation was built on the riches of sea island cotton - and on the backs of enslaved people whose work and culture are embedded in the Lowcountry's very foundation. It is a living tribute to the men and women and their descendants that persevered in their efforts to achieve freedom, equality, and justice. All of their stories - black and white, enslaved and free - are given their due. After years of careful research and restoration, McLeod Plantation Historic Site invites visitors to embark upon an in-depth exploration of the lives of those people whose stories are essential to understanding Charleston's complex past and helped shape who we, as a nation, are today.","325 Country Club Dr, Charleston, SC 29412-2215",,"Charleston Crab House-James Island,Maple Street Biscuit Company,Duke's BBQ","Tradesman Brewing Company,Robert Lange Studios,The 34 West Theater Company",982,212,62,28,26,9,16

Crowley's Ridge, a geologic anomaly, is the most unusual of Arkansas's six major physiographic provinces, or natural divisions. It is covered with a lush, mixed hardwood forest including oak, hickory, and uncommon hardwood trees such as American Beech, Sugar Maple, Butternut, Basswood, Cucumbertree, Kentucky Coffeetree, and Tuliptree or Yellow Poplar. Village Creek State Park is one of five Arkansas state parks on Crowley's Ridge. At 6,911 acres, Village Creek is Arkansas's second largest state park in land area. Park interpretive programs and exhibits share the story of the natural and cultural heritage of Crowley's Ridge. Five park trails totaling seven miles allow hikers the opportunity to explore this forest on their own, or on a guided trail walk with a park interpreter. A multi-use trail system within the park offers both mountain biking and hiking. Anglers can fish for bass, bream, catfish, and crappie at the park's two lakes, Lake Austell and Lake Dunn. Launch ramps, boat docks, bait, fishing boats, electric motors, and pedal boats are available late-spring through Labor Day. Visitors can bring their own canoe or kayak for some scenic paddling. The park campground includes 96 campsites [24 Class AAA, five Class A, and 67 Class B sites (for RVs, tents, and horse campers)] around Lake Dunn. Nestled on a nearby ridge are the park's 10 fully-equipped cabins that feature kitchens and wood-burning fireplaces–ready for a comfortable weekend stay. At Lake Austell, picnic sites are near a sandy beach and sun deck. The park also includes four standard pavilions (one is enclosed), playgrounds, baseball and multi-use fields, and a driving range. Horseback riding is a popular activity at this park. Twenty-five miles of multi-use trails wind through the rolling hills of Crowley's Ridge. The horse trails are open throughout the year. Call the park for current trail conditions. The horse camp features 30 campsites with water and electric hookups, an asphalt parking pad, picnic table and grill; a modern bathhouse; horse wash bays; and 66 stalls inside the camping area. The horse stable's 10' x 10' stalls include water, electric, and ceiling fans. The park visitor center includes an A/V theater, store, gift shop, and bicycle rentals. The interpretive center offers a large meeting facility and The Discovery Room featuring exhibits of prehistoric artifacts and information about the wildlife of Crowley's Ridge. Our helpful park interpreters offer education-focused programs, concerts, and special events throughout the year. Golfers will enjoy The Ridges at Village Creek, the park's 27-hole, Andy Dye signature course. This public course features the rolling terrain of Crowley's Ridge, dramatic elevation changes, and the backdrop of the seasonal beauty of the surrounding hardwood forest. These combine with the PGA-caliber championship layout for an aesthetically pleasing and challenging level of play. Since 1923, the Dye family designs of resort and public courses have included world-ranked championship-class courses including 17 of the world’s top 100 courses. Dye designs have a worldwide reputation for their creative, unique designs, and environmentally sensitive integrity. Depending on the configuration of the two nines you choose to play, the yardage could stretch to over 7,400 yards. The course features MiniVerde Bermuda greens and Tiff 419 Bermuda tees and fairways. Four teeing areas make the course accessible for golfers of any skill level. Three distinct nines offer outstanding golf opportunities. Water comes into play on 12 holes. The course is open daily and includes a full-service clubhouse with pro shop, dressing rooms, snack bar, and full driving range. Golf carts are included with greens fee.",,,,,37,24,2,5,0,-1,-1

Boldt, millionaire proprietor of the world-famous Waldorf Astoria Hotel in NYC, set out to build a full-sized Rhineland Castle in Alexandria Bay, on Heart Island. The grandiose structure was to be a display of his love for his wife, Louise. Beginning in 1900, Boldt's family shared four summers on Wellesley Island while 300 workers, stonemasons, carpenters and artists fashioned the six story, 120-room castle, complete with tunnels, a powerhouse, Italian gardens, a drawbridge and a dovecote. In 1904, tragedy struck. Boldt telegrammed the island and commanded the workers to immediately ""stop all construction."" Louise had died suddenly. A broken-hearted Boldt could not imagine his dream castle without his beloved. Three hundred workers laid down their tools.

Set on more than 1,200 acres in the heart of the Kentucky's famous Bluegrass region, the park is THE place to get close to horses! Featuring dozens of breeds of horse at work and at play, the park showcases the horse in daily equine presentations, horse drawn tours, horseback and pony rides, and an array of horse shows and special events throughout the year. The park's International Museum of the Horse, a Smithsonian Affiliate, is the world's largest equestrian museum. Offering both the experienced horseman and novice an opportunity to explore the many facets of humanity's relationship with the horse, the museum is dedicated to all breeds and disciplines of horse and covers some 50-million years of equine history. State-of-the-art technology complements rare artifacts and scholarly research to present a unique, educational, museum experience for all ages. The American Saddlebred Museum, the Showplace for Saddlebreds, celebrates Kentucky's first native breed of horse. The museum features interactive exhibits and a movie. With the park's own tourist activities and the numerous additional horse shows that take place in the equine competition facilities throughout the year, there can be a fair amount of walking involved, depending on visitor interest level. Comfortable shoes and clothing is recommended, appropriate for Kentucky's seasonal weather. Dogs and other pets are permitted on park grounds, as long as they are on a leash or in an approved carrier, although they may not be permitted in some buildings.","4089 Iron Works Pkwy, Lexington, KY 40511-8400",,"Hayden's Stockyard,Subway,Red State BBQ","American Saddlebred Museum,Hagyard Equine Medical Institute,Spy Coast Farm",1989,545,144,31,19,9,17

They searched all over the surrounding area but could not find any access into the cave. So, they drilled a 2 foot wide hole down through 33.5 feet of limestone bedrock. The hole became known as the Discovery Hole as it was the very first entrance into the cave (and the only one for several months!).

It is the city's signature landmark and has become a post-Katrina symbol of the city's resolve and resilience. The light was civilian operated from 1848 to 1939, and is notable for its several female lightkeepers, including Maria Younghans, who tended the light for 53 years. In 1939, the U.S. Coast Guard assumed responsibility for the light's operation.After being declared surplus property in 1968, the Biloxi Lighthouse was deeded to the City of Biloxi, which eventually opened it to public tours.The lighthouse has withstood many storms over the years. Katrina's storm surge enveloped a third of the 64-foot tall lighthouse, and the constant pounding from the water and winds toppled many bricks that lined the interior of the cast iron tower. The storm’s winds also broke many of the windows in the light cupola and destroyed the structure's electrical systemIn March 2010, the city re-opened the lighthouse to public tours after a 14-month, $400,000 restoration that was funded by FEMA and MEMA and completed by Biloxi contractor J.O.

Appleton was one of the first three cities in the world to be lit by an Edison central power station, the other two being New York and London. This was all due to Mr. Rogers, who decided to invest in Edison’s power station in order to light two paper mills and his home.

Hurricane Irene flooded much of the state soon-after, causing widespread damage in downtown Waterbury, including the Pub. Forced to shut the Pub doors, the Kimmichs focused their efforts on the new Cannery and distributing Heady Topper locally. Pop-up truck sales, long lines in Waterbury, and a booming craft beer scene led up to the opening of the 2016 Stowe Brewery and Visitor’s Center. Today, The Alchemist operates two breweries in Waterbury and Stowe and distributes Heady Topper and Focal Banger throughout the state, with the occasional out-of-state shipment.

In the early 1800s, William Brailsford of Charleston carved a rice plantation from marshes along the Altamaha River. The plantation and its inhabitants were part of the genteel low country society that developed during the antebellum period. While many factors made rice cultivation increasingly difficult in the years after the Civil War, the family continued to grow rice until 1913.The enterprising siblings of the fifth generation at Hofwyl-Broadfield resolved to start a dairy rather than sell their family home. The efforts of Gratz, Miriam and Ophelia Dent led to the preservation of their family legacy. Ophelia was the last heir to the rich traditions of her ancestors, and she left the plantation to the state of Georgia in 1973.A museum features silver from the family collection and a model of Hofwyl-Broadfield during its heyday. A brief film on the plantation’s history is shown before visitors walk a short trail to the antebellum home. A guided tour allows visitors to see the home as Ophelia kept it with family heirlooms, 18th and 19th century furniture and Cantonese china. A stop on the Colonial Coast Birding Trail, this is an excellent spot to look for herons, egrets, ibis and painted buntings. A nature trail that leads back to the Visitors Center along the edge of the marsh where rice once flourished.","5556 US Highway 17 N, Brunswick, GA 31525-4651",,,"Fort King George State Historic Site,Butler Island Plantation,Golden Isles Welcome Center",416,161,37,6,5,9,17

I relocated from Brazil to Alaska in 2001 and have been chasing and photographing Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) ever since. I never heard about the Northern Lights before I moved to Alaska. The first time I saw them it was love at first sight. That was it! From there on I knew what I wanted to do, I wanted to share the Auroras with the world and show them to everyone who doesn't have the opportunity to see the Northern lights. That's what I have been doing since. From long and cold nights photographing amazing auroras through the skies, and teaching northern lights photography workshops, to the summers explaining and showing the auroras to the ones that are not able to visit Alaska in the winters. I am a photographer in Alaska, living the dream life of many photographers.

The four pools contain an ancient sea water abundant with a relaxing and therapeutic blend of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, silica, sodium and more. The source is 142 degrees F, but the pools are kept at a comfortable 102-104 degrees. The water is natural, and no chlorine or chemicals are added. We use ultraviolet light, ionizers and an oxygen inversions system to disinfect the water, and they are flow-through pools, so the water changes out regularly.

Hangar # 1 was listed onto the National Register of Historic Places in September of 1997. Naval Air station (NAS) Wildwood was commissioned on April 1, 1943. The site served as an active dive-bomber squadron training facility from 1943 to 1945. Aircraft stationed at NAS Wildwood included TBM Avengers, Douglas Dauntlesses, Vought Corsairs and Curtiss Helldivers. Forty-two airmen perished while training at NAS Wildwood during World War II. In June 1997, NASW Foundation purchased Hangar #1 at the Cape May Airport. The 92,000 square-foot all-wooden structure was in a state of disrepair and required extensive renovation. Under the stewardship of NASW Foundation, the hangar was listed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places at the National Significance Level. NAS Wildwood Aviation Museum now boasts over 26 aircraft displays as well as exhibits of military memorabilia, engines, photographs and more. Additionally, the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia has provided NAS Wildwood with a wealth of interactive exhibits that allow visitors to discover the science of flight. The museum also features a library, food vending area as well as a recently expanded gift shop. In its role as a community resource, NAS Wildwood Aviation Museum regularly hosts activities including fly-ins, aviation festivals, big band concerts, swing dances, veterans’ ceremonies, historical lectures, school field trips and senior tours.","500 Forrestal Rd Cape May Airport, Cape May, NJ 08204",,"Flight Deck Diner,Taco Shop,Wingnutz","Forgotten Warriors,Cape May Brewing Company,Hawk Haven Vineyard and Winery",675,233,35,5,4,10,16

The Mystery Spot has amazed and perplexed hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world, and many return time and time again to experience these puzzling variations of gravity, perspective, and height. Some speculate that cones of metal were secretly brought here and buried in our earth as guidance systems for their spacecraft. Some think that it is in fact the spacecraft itself buried deep within the ground.

The town thrived for 12 years, until the price of silver plunged and mining operations ceased. By 1907, residents had moved away, leaving Calico to the tumbleweeds and spirits.Amenities include group and RV camping, mountain bike trails and off-road vehicle areas, fourteen shops, three restaurants, cabins and bunkhouses. Special events are held year-round, including Civil War re-enactments in February, Spring Festival featuring Americana music, the Calico Days Festival when the town’s rich mining history is celebrated with a burro race, miner’s triathlon, music and more, and let’s not overlook the ever-popular Halloween Ghost Haunt in October. The desert park is just a few miles north of Barstow, and minutes offInterstate 15.
